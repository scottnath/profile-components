# GitHub profile components

Includes two web components:

* `<github-repository>` - displays information about a GitHub repository
* `<github-user>` - displays information about a GitHub user, includes `<github-repository>`

see README at root of repo for usage details

## @todo

- [ ] add process.env option to include github token for local development
  * REST api has a 60-calls-per-hour limit for unauthenticated requests
  * adding a local-dev token option would make development easier
- [ ] css styles method which outputs a css string for primer vars
  * for local roll-ur-own vars-primer.css
  * could be used to create alternative smaller dist versions
- [ ] add long names and matching stories
